          We believe every New Yorker should have the power to make their city better. Thatâ€™s why we created a fun, interactive way to report public issues, 
          from broken hydrants to bus delays and damaged sidewalks, all while earning badges and leveling up your civic impact.
          <br /><br />
          Our mission is to turn community awareness into action by combining real-world impact with the spirit of friendly competition. Every report helps 
          the city improve.
